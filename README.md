# RESIZY 👉👈 / 👈👉

## Save your fragile designer wrists and get resizy, yo.

Do you ever get tired of selecting a layer on the artboard, dragging your poor mouse all over your glossy Retina screen, struggling to hit the teensy tiny size forms just to resize your object? If you are, you're damn right to be. If you ain't, well you should be.

It's time to get resizy, brother.

Supported features:
* One handed shortcut: **CMD + CTRL + SHIFT + A** (Never accept a shortcut which requires two hands. You're better than that.)
* Getting resizy with a single layer.
* Getting resizy with multiple layers.
* Getting resizy through arithmetic operations, dog.

To be implemented:
* ~~Math Operators~~
* Custom resizing point
* World Peace.
